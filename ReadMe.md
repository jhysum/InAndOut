InAndOut is a home utility app that allows housemates to seamlessly know who is home and who is out. With this information they can plan quick events without have to text everyone. InAndOut also automatically sync all the housemate's wifi to the home wifi. Along with synced calendar, bill splitting between housemates, and chores, every house should be using InAndOut.(last 3 features were not implemented for this hackathon)
